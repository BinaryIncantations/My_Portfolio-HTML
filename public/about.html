<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I spent the first 10 years of my life working into the food industry. I exceled at everything I tried and quickly 
  moved into management. I spent 5 years as a General Manager at Wendy's. During my tenure at Wendy's I won an award 
  for being a top 100 General Manager. Food service was not for me, I felt styfled and unchallenged. My true passion 
  was in technology. I began studying for the Comptia A+ exam and passed it in 2021. I took a job working for Geek 
  Squad where I could begin to grow my talent and love of technology. I learned OS troubleshooting and hardware troubleshooting,
  I learned clear and concise communication and note taking. Again I exceled and within a year I was leading my precinct
  and was promoted to Senior Counter Intelligence Agent. I used my time at Geek Squad well and began studying for my passion
  coding.Hello World! I did it I spent the next year studying to code and even though I worked 40 hours a week, I would study for 4 hours a day before work every day.
